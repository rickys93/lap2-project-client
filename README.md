### Florin Events App
The Florin Events App is a web application that allows users to create events, view other people's events, and declare interest in attending events. Users can view events by category and search for events using the search bar. The application was created to help a struggling county council that was struggling with funding issues. The project was built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and SQL and consists of both a frontend and a backend.

### Installation
To install the frontend, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine using git clone.
Navigate to the root directory of the project in the terminal.
Run npm install to install the necessary dependencies.
Run the application using an extension like live server to run the frontend.
To use the application, make sure that you are connected to your database and create an account. Alternatively, you can use the app online as it is hosted on https://florin-events.onrender.com/.

### Usage
Once the application is installed, users can register as a user, create events, view other people's events, and declare interest in attending events. Users can also view events by category and search for events using the search bar.
